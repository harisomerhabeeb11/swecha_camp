Real world usage of

1. Matrices

Elevation map of a sandy beach.
elevation <- matrix(1, 10, 10)
elevation[3, 7] <- 0
elevation[4, 6] <- 2
contour(elevation)
persp(elevation)
Save the plots. What are contour and persp functions?

2. Data Frames
Now take some real world data, ex. crime rate by countries and irregioosity(atheism) by country, find relationship between them.
save the plots.
